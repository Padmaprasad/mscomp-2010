Monte Carlo integration
=======================

**Level**: Basic (language,basic libraries)

Compute $\pi$ via `Monte Carlo integration`_.  To do this, think of a
function whose integral is related to $\pi$ (e.g. $\int_0^1
{1/(1+x^2)} dx$), and then compute this integral via Monte Carlo
integration.

Try several different functions and compare.

.. The spanish version has a simpler explanation of the method.

   .. literalinclude:: sol/montecarlo_pi.py

   This code includes a weave-enabled version of the computation, to illustrate
   how certain cases can be easily sped up with very little effort.
