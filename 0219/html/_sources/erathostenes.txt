Prime numbers and the sieve of Erathostenes
===========================================

**Level**: Basic (language,basic libraries)

The sieve of Erathostenes is a simple and famous algorithm for
factoring prime numbers.  You will find a nice explanation of the
algorithm in Wikipedia_.

Try to implement it in Python, and think of different data structures
you may use to do this.

Time the various implementations, do some analysis of the run times of
each.

   Solution
   --------

   .. literalinclude:: sol/erathostenes.py
   
   After calling ``time_sieves()``, we can see how much impact different data
   structure choices can have on algorithm run time:
