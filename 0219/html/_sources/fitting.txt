Simple fitting
==============

**Level**: Medium (scientific libraries, plotting)

Test different methods of fitting using a signal with known source.

#. Generate data pairs $(x,y)$ in the range $x \in [0,4]$ from the
   target function:

   .. math::

      y(x) = a \exp(\alpha x) + k

   Using the following choice of constants: $a=2, \alpha=-0.75,
   k=0.1$.

#. Add zero-mean gaussian noise to $y$, with amplitude $0.1$ to create
   a noisy version of the signal.

#. Fit the noisy data using the following methods: least-square fit to
   the analytical form, splines (from ``scipy.interpolate``),
   polynomial fit (from ``numpy``) of orders 0, 1 and 2.

#. Plot the data and the results from the fitting procedures and
   Compare graphically the fitting methods.
