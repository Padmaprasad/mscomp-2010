Fractals
========

**Level**: Medium (plotting)

A simple ilustration of fractal curve is the von Koch curve K.

.. math::
    :label: trapzf

    K=S_{\infty}

This curve is constructed by the following procedure mentioned below:
In the iteration $S_0$ we take a line segment of longitud L and split
it in three equal parts and the middle one is substracted. Then we
replace the missing segment with the other two sides of an equlateral
triangle.

The remaining iterations consist in repeat the procedure for each one
or the segments in the previous approximation.

Write a python script to plot the six first iteration in the
construction of the von Koch curve as ilustrated in the figure.
