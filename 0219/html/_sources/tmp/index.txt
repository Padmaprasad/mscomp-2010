Modern scientific computing - problem set
=========================================

We present below a list of selected problems intended to challenge the
skills of Scientific Python Programmers.  Problems are sorted
according to their level of complexity and the increasing number of
required skills needed to solve them.  

Try to solve first the simpler problems and go next through the more
complex ones.
