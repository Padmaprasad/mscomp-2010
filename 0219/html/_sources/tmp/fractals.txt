Fractals
========

A simple ilustration of fractal curve it the 
von Koch curve K.

.. math::
    :label: trapzf
    K=S_{inf}

Wich is constructed by the procedure mentioned below:
To form the iteration $S_0$
we take a line segment of longitud L. The segment is
splitted in three equal parts and the middle one is
substracted. Then we replace the missing segment with
the other two sides of an equlateral triangle.

Subsecuently iteration consist in repeat the procedure for
each one or the segments in the previous approximation.

In this exercise, you are asked to plot the six first 
iteration in the construction of the von Koch curve
as ilustrated in the figure.
