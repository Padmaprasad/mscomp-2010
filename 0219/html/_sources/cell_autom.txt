Cellular automata
=================

**Level**: Basic (language, basic libraries, plotting)

Compute the evolution of a 2D Cellular Automaton (CA) given a random
initial state, a simple set of cell update rules and a given boundary
condition.

As an example create one of the most famous CA, The Life Game:

1. Generate a 2D matrix of integer values between 0 and 3 (0: dead
   cell, 1: recently born, 2: alive, 3: recently dead.)

2. Update the state of each cell using the following conditions:
   
   1. If a cell is dead but there are exactly 3 neighbor cells alive,
   she will born (passes from state 0 to state 1)
   
   2. If a cell is alive and there are 2 or 3 neighbor cells alive she
   stays alive (passes from state 1 to 2 or stays in state 2),
   otherwise it dies (passes from state 2 to 3).

3. Use a *cold* boundary condition, i.e. all the cells beyond the
   boundary of the CA are dead.

4. Plot the state of the CA on each step.

**Bonus**: Create an animation of the evolution of the Automaton.

**Bonus**: Change the boundary condition. Options are: *hot* boundary
  condition (all the cells outside are alive), periodic boundary
  condition or a reflecting boundary condition.
